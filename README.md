Using regression machine learning algorithms, the idea is to make sales forecasts per store in order to define the budget for investment in each unit. The method used in this project was the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining). Analyzing the MAE, MAPE and RMSE errors, the algorithm that presented the best accuracy, and therefore, used in this project, was XGBoost.
